### About me

I'm a passionate web developer with one year of professional experience in the industry. Currently, my focus is on building applications using a tech stack that includes TypeScript, React Query, Next.js, and Chakra UI. My technical toolkit encompasses a diverse set of technologies, including TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Redux, Next.js, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL.

In my current role, I don't just code; I also handle functional analysis and create mockups. While we operate under agile methodologies, I stand out by taking on and executing various tasks, actively engaging in the development process.

I've had the privilege of collaborating with a multidisciplinary team of developers, enriching my experience in terms of teamwork and continuous learning. Additionally, I'm constantly updating my skills through courses, such as the most recent one I completed in C#.

My primary passion lies in frontend development, but my future vision is directed towards the realm of mobile development. I'm excited about the prospect of delving into creating my own mobile applications, exploring the intersection between user experience and functionality in this field.
